- Creating a rectangle abstraction using struct. 
- Creating two functions to calculate area and circumference of given rectangle instance and set produced values on given rectangle instance. 
- Creating another function to create an instance of rectangle struct and return it. But that function would be able to return an error in case of passing invalid arguments such as negative length or height.
